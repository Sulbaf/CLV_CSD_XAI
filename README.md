# CLV_CSD_XAI
CLV_CSD_XAI Implementation.

This study produced an ante-hoc model based on Decision Tree (DT), post-hoc model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and an ensemble of the two (LSTM and DT) models for improving CLV accuracy, interpretability and explainability of AI-based model in multi-category electronic market. The adopted methodology for this research is based on Predictive Analytics Model for Customer Behaviour. For robustness of the product CLV prediction and explanations and to ensure fair comparison with previous studies on XAI and CLV, an open-source eCommerce Behaviour Data from multi-category store was used.
